## Description

This is a website that features two lists, burgers that are not devoured and burgers that are devoured, as well as a form where the user can add a burger. The list of burgers that are not devoured is populated by an initial list of burgers with devour buttons right under them. If the user clicks on the button, the burger is "devoured" and then moves to the list of burgers that have been devoured. The button is removed and now just says devoured. If the user types in a burger into the "Add a Burger" form, the new burger will be added to the burgers that are not devoured list.
